				<p><em>Why change careers?</em>  Simple: <strong>I want a challenge</strong>.</p>
				<p>Hmm... where to start?  I suppose I'll make this long story a short one.</p>
				<p>I have been a secondary level (grades 7-12) Math teacher in the State of Maryland and I really do enjoy the job.  My degree is in Pure Mathematics, and I received my teaching certification soon after that.</p>
				<p><em>So why teaching?</em></p>
				<p>I was searching for a deeply satisfying job that would challenge me, and at the time I determined that teaching had the potential to be exactly that.  I had to plan, teach, and assess over a hundred students day in and day out.  I differentiated instruction so that I could reach all learners.  I incorporated educational technology that was ideal for the 21st century learner.  I collaborated with faculty and staff to deliver cross-content instruction.  I communicated with parents on a daily basis in order to keep them updated on their child's progress.  I really enjoyed designing creative and relevant assignments that kids would be interested in.  And most importantly, I did my best to instill the value of "doing the right thing" to my students.  It was <strong>challenging</strong>.</p>
				<p><em>Whoa, you just said it was challenging.  Isn't that what you wanted?</em></p>
				<p>For a while there, I thought it was what I wanted.  Don't get me wrong.  Teaching has challenged me in ways I never even thought were possible, and it really is a great feeling to know that you made a positive impact on a child's life.  But it just wasn't as satisfying as I thought it would be.  So I had to take some time and revisit the question: <em>Why teaching?</em></p>
				<p>And then it hit me.  I got into education because I loved math.  Above everything else, I enjoyed solving problems.  I remember back to my Math major when I would write a multiple page proof, or solve a complex problem, and think about how <em>satisfying</em> that was.  So while teaching was a great challenge, I figured out why it wasn't as satisfying as I thought it was going to be.  It was because I wasn't being <strong>challenged</strong> in the right way.</p>
				<p><em>So why web development?</em></p>
				<p>Because creativity meets problem solving.  It takes my favorite part from teaching (<strong>the opportunity to be creative</strong>) and combines it with what I truly find satisfying (<strong>problem solving</strong>).</p>
				<p>So here I am wrapping up my first blog post on the first website I've ever made.  I feel like I have learned so much in such a short amount of time, and I just want to keep learning.  That's another thing I can take away from teaching--it taught me to appreciate learning.  I've never felt this excited and passionate about something since completing my Math degree in college, and I can't wait to start my Master's in Comp Sci this fall.</p>
				<p>I look forward to keeping you posted on my journey in learning about web development.  Future posts won't be as heavy as this one, so be sure to check this page for great resources, tutorials, articles, best practices, etc. that I come across as I begin my new career.</p>

				<p>Hey all!  A lot has been on the plate of learning for myself as I have so much to learn and not enough time.  As I make significant progress on my current projects (<a href="img/heezler.jpg">Heezler.com</a> and <a href="#">jHelper.com</a>), I thought I'd post an update.</p>
				<p>I finally came up with a name for my mock-Twitter project -- Heezler.  Much like Twitter's name not making much sense, I thought Heezler was kind of perfect.  Anyways, I decided to <a href="http://youtu.be/gKiaLSJW5xI?list=UUVTlvUkGslCV_h-nSAId8Sw">master my front-end workflow</a> with <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a>.  Let me just say this: <strong>YEOMAN IS AWESOME!</strong>  It literally saves you a TON of time by templating out your .html, .css, and .js files for you.  All of that time you would spend hand-coding the foundation of your website will be saved!  I used their standard webapp generator, but there are tons you can fool around with.  Their most popular generator is actually for the <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular">Angular.js</a> framework, and I can't wait to start using it.  They even have a <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator-mobile">Mobile App</a> generator.  Needless to say, Yeoman kicks ass.</p>
				<p>On a related note, I've noticed that I've had to make a lot of decisions regarding what to learn next.  Should I learn Bootstrap before Angular?  Should I master JavaScript before jQuery?  Do I need to be a CSS ninja?  These are just a few questions I have asked myself in the past couple weeks.  I don't really think there is a wrong path because eventually you'll want to learn it all.  And if you encounter something that's a little above your head, just backtrack a bit and fill in the gaps you're missing.</p>
				<p>For now, I will be working on Heezler.com and jHelper.com.  With Heezler, I will be focusing on implementing Bootstrap and smart JavaScript.  With jHelper, I will be focusing on the basics of JavaScript and jQuery, and incorporating them into the page.  That way, if I need to take a break from Bootstrap I can work with JavaScript, and vice versa.</p>
				<p>Alright all, until next time.  Be cool!</p>

				<p>So today is the big day!  I finally feel comfortable enough with my first website to go ahead and put it online for the world to see.  There are still so many things I want to add/change about it, but I want to have something out there I can show to potential recruiters/employers that demonstrates some technical competency.</p>
				<p>This website was coded completely from scratch and I used a ton of great (and free!) resources that allowed me to learn so much in such a short time.  Here they are:
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com/</a> - CRUCIAL! No joke I spent days on this site learning the basics of HTML and CSS.  Tons of hands-on examples where you can modify and play with the code.</li>
						<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/learncodeacademy">LearnCode.academy</a> - This one is also CRUCIAL!  You can watch incredible tutorial videos from a current web dev professional.  Great resource.</li>
						<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a> - So many of the problems that I ran into throughout this process I found answers to on stackoverflow.  Just search the problem, and more likely than not you'll find the answer to your problem.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
				<p>Next on the agenda is to implement some basic back-end technology, and to continue to enhance the layout/functionality with jQuery and Sass.  Until next time, peace!</p>
